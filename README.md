# Arduino Sketches

Arduino sketch programs for the JQI Sr lab.

## CurrentController

This is the code running on our [current controllers](https://jqi-wiki.physics.umd.edu/d/documentation/electronics/current_controller).

## DACBoardServer

Code running on the 8-channel DAC box on the rack by the red laser.

## DDSBox

Code running on the 3-channel DDS ["Frequency Breakout" box](https://jqi-wiki.physics.umd.edu/d/documentation/electronics/frequency_breakout_board).

Ideas for updates/improvements:

* Use rotary encoder instead of potentiometer for setpoint
